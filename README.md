## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript 

### What I learned

I really have not done a lot of vanilla JS so it stretched me a little to learn some more about working with the DOM. I also learned a bit more about accessability, in this case using e.g a button for the rating selections rather than just a div because it comes with a level of accessability baked in.

### Continued development

I will need to run through this one again, tidy up my CSS, simplify and refine with the hope of reducing the amount of needed classes. I may repeat the same card using grid rather than flexbox for my layout.

Didn't use this solution but it was worth a read.
